Face Mask Detection

Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m2iqJckxwTlkrVc3sxx_Xd1GM1nFqt22?usp=sharing

Face Mask Detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Python, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV.

The above program can check whether the user is wearing a mask or not. With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world

Challenges Faced:
Collecting the dataset of images of people wearing mask and not wearing mask. 
Data Processing
Training the Convolutional Neural Network

To implement the project, make sure you have your web cam enabled. Run the files on jupyter notebook, install the dataset and cascade classifier to detect faces.
